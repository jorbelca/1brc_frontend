# Project: Frontend Technologies Comparison in the 1 Billion Rows Challenge

## Project Description

This project aims to compare various frontend technologies in the implementation of the "1 Billion Rows Challenge." The goal is to analyze the performance and efficiency of different tools and frameworks when handling large volumes of data.

## Project Goals

- **Learning:** Learn and get a first approach of the technologies used.
- **Performance:** Evaluate the performance of each technology when handling large volumes of data.
- **Ease of Development:** Analyze the ease of use and development time with each technology.

## Technologies Used

In this project, the following frontend technologies are implemented and compared:

- **Web Workers + Vanilla JS**
- **Web GPU**
- **WebAssembly (C++)**

## Project Status

- **Web Workers + Vanilla JS:** ‚úÖ Completed. The result was less than 3 minutes.
- **Web GPU:** üöß A first version is available but not functional.
- **WASM:** ‚ùå Development has not started yet.
